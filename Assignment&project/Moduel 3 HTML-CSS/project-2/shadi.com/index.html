                            because you made a small mistake, instead of getting angry or defensive,
                            try laughing at yourself. Remember she is as nervous as you are (or more!) and it could just
                            be her nerves showing.

                            Another ego issue is your treatment of people around you. Waiters, valet, taxi drivers, or
                            cooks may not follow your instructions.
                            Your interaction with these people will show her how you will act with her when the newness
                            has worn out. Always be kind, generous,
                            and forgiving. (that last one is something we should all aspire to all the time).
